### Features

- **Evil Twin Attack**:  
Creates a rogue access point (AP) mimicking the target network, tricking clients into connecting to it.

- **Advanced deauthentication technique**:  
Supports new adavanced technique for wifi 6 deauthentication like negative tx power constraint, EAPOL-logoff, EAP-Failure, Malformed Handshare message 1, Invalid PMKID, EAPOL Rounds and EAPOL start spamming.

- **Automatic Vendor Identification**:  
Support for vendor identification based on SSID name and capturing beacon frame (TO DO).

- **Phishing Scenarios**:  
Serves customized phishing pages to capture sensitive information such as login credentials.

- **Compact and Portable**:  
  Runs on the ESP32, making it lightweight and suitable for hardware testing scenarios.

- **Configurable via Web Interface**:  
  Allows customization of network settings and phishing scenarios through a web interface.

# WifiPhisher for ESP32

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)](https://github.com/Alexxdal/WifiPhisher)

WifiPhisher for ESP32 is a custom implementation of a phishing tool designed for the ESP32 microcontroller. It performs Evil Twin attacks, allowing users to test the security of Wi-Fi networks and execute social engineering phishing scenarios. The project is built using **PlatformIO** and the **ESP-IDF framework**.


## Requirements

### Hardware

- **ESP32 Development Board**:  
  Any ESP32 board with Wi-Fi capability (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32).

- **Power Source**:  
  A USB connection or battery to power the ESP32.

### Software

- **PlatformIO**:  
  Integrated into your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code). [Install PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install).

- **ESP-IDF Framework**:  
  Required for building and flashing the firmware. PlatformIO automatically configures this as part of the development environment.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexxdal/WifiPhisher.git
cd WifiPhisher
```

### 2. Configure PlatformIO

Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and ensure that PlatformIO is correctly set up:

1. Check the `platformio.ini` file in the project root:
   - Verify that the `platform`, `board`, and `framework` match your ESP32 development board.
   - Example configuration in `platformio.ini`:
     ```ini
     [env:esp32dev]
     platform = espressif32
     board = esp32dev
     framework = espidf
     ```
2. Install necessary dependencies by allowing PlatformIO to resolve them during the first build.

### 3. Build and Upload

To build and upload the firmware to your ESP32:

1. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
2. In the PlatformIO terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

### 4. Monitor Logs

To debug or monitor the ESP32's output logs:
1. Use PlatformIO serial monitor:
  ```bash
   pio device monitor
   ```
2. To stop the monitor, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Usage

#### 1. Access Web Interface
1. Connect to the ESP32 rogue AP (default: "MagicWifi").
2. Open a browser and go to `http://192.168.4.1:8080/`.

#### 2. Configure the Attack
1. Select the target Wi-Fi network to impersonate.
2. Choose a phishing scenario (e.g., fake login page).

#### 3. Run the Attack
Once configured, the ESP32 will execute the Evil Twin attack and serve the phishing page.
